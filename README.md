# Creating a Simple GitHub API Example Application
Let's setup a simple project that will display the data of the specified username right on our webpage.

## 1. Create directory named `github-api` on your desktop
Let's create directory on our desktop named `github-api` which will hold the files to our simple GitHub API example application.

## 2. Within `github-api` directory, add file `index.html`
This file will contain the HTML markup for our web app.

## 3. Within `github-api` directory, add file `app.js`
This file will contain the code we just wrote. We will tweak it along the way to get it to display the requested data on the webpage.
